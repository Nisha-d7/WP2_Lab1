# Web Programming & Framework 2 - ITE-5425-0NB
Lab 1 - React Foundation

#Curve and Challenges:
Some concepts in React were completely new to me, especially state, components, and props. At first, understanding how components are reused and how data is passed through props was a bit confusing. The idea of hooks, like useState, and how state allows a component to "remember" values over time took some time to fully understand.

Another challenge was how React re-renders components when state changes.Despite these challenges, I found the provided course materials and examples are very clear and helped me understand the basic concepts step by step. Very detailed explanations with practical examples.

The interesting thing i found like as we start using more modern concepts like declarative programming ,the need to write lengthy, step-by-step code is reduced. This makes the code more readable and cleaner, easier to understand, also reduced the amount of code I needed to write for complex tasks.
